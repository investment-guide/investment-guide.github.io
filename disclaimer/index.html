                <p><em>Who are we?</em></p>
                <p>This website is owned by Investoo Group.</p>
                <p><em>Can you give me advice?</em></p>
                <p>Sorry, we can’t give you advice on which broker to 
use, when to invest, how much to invest or what to invest in. Please 
read our risk warning and disclaimer (below). If you are still unsure 
after using our site it would be a good idea to get independent advice 
from a qualified professional financial advisor.</p>
                <p><em>How do you make money?</em></p>
                <p>Our site is free for you to use. Instead of charging 
you to use our site, we make money from the brokers and business 
partners with whom we have commercial arrangements. This can happen in a
 number of ways; for example when you click a button and go through to a
 broker’s website, or when you open an account with that broker.</p>
                <p>Our broker lists and comparisons may not list or 
compare all relevant brokers, exchanges or investments and are by 
default ordered by reference to our commercial agreements unless 
otherwise stated. We may list products or brokers that we don’t make 
money from, and you can identify them because they will appear without a
 “button”, or in another colour.</p>
                <p>Brokers and other service providers may also pay us 
to advertise on our site, or to feature in our emails, know how guides 
and/or articles.</p>
                <p>By using our site, you agree to us receiving and retaining fees from our business partners.</p>
                <p><em>How do you use my data?</em></p>
                <p>Please see our data privacy policy.</p>
                <p><em>Would you like to know more?</em></p>
                <p>If you would like more information or have any questions, don’t hesitate to get in touch by email at support@onlineinvestmentsguide.com.</p>
                <p><em>Risk Warning</em></p>
                <p>Investing is speculative and carries a high level of risk. Each investment is unique and involves unique risks.</p>
                <p>When trading in<strong> stocks and other negotiable securities </strong>your capital is at risk.</p>
                <p><strong> </strong></p>
                <p><strong>CFDs and other derivatives</strong> are 
complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly 
due to leverage. You should consider whether you understand how an 
investment works and whether you can afford to take the high risk of 
losing your money. CFD and derivative trading may not be legal in your 
country of residence. Please check the legality of your chosen 
investment before investing.</p>
                <p>In all cases, past performance is not an indication 
of future results. Trading history presented may be less than 5 years 
old unless otherwise stated and may not suffice as a basis for 
investment decisions. Prices may go down as well as up, prices can 
fluctuate widely, you may be exposed to currency exchange rate 
fluctuations and you may lose all of or more than the amount you invest.
 Investing is not suitable for everyone, so please ensure that you have 
fully understood the risks and legalities involved. If you are unsure, 
seek independent financial, legal, tax and/or accounting advice. This 
website does not provide investment, financial, legal, tax or accounting
 advice.</p>
